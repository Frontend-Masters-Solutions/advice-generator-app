# Frontend Mentor - Advice Generator App solution

This is a solution to the [Advice generator app challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/advice-generator-app-QdUG-13db). Frontend Mentor challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects.

## Built with

-   HTML5
-   Tailwind CSS
-   JavaScript (Vanilla)
-   [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
-   [Advice Slip API](https://api.adviceslip.com)

## Run Locally

Clone the project:

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/Frontend-Masters-Solutions/advice-generator-app.git
```

Go to the project directory:

```bash
  cd advice-generator-app
```

Install dependencies (Tailwind CSS):

##### Note: Make sure you have Node.js installed.

```bash
  npm install
```

Start the Tailwind CLI build process:

```bash
  npx tailwindcss -i ./styles.css -o ./output.css --watch
```

Now you can make changes to the Tailwind classes in the `index.html` file, and the changes will be reflected as you save the file.
